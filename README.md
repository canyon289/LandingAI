# LandingAI

This repo contains a small demostration demonstrating CNN training
performed on a synthetic dataset to classify "defective" images
from correct ones but with final classification done on a manufactured
part.

The goal of this project was to demonstrate one way in which AI
systems can be created in a time and cost efficient matter but
with real world results

## Results
The results of this exercise can be found in the
[Recognizer jupyter notebook](https://github.com/canyon289/LandingAI/blob/master/notebook/Recognizer.ipynb)
contained in the notebook directory

## Repository Contents
### landingai
Python installable module that contains utilities to generate synthetic images, preprocess camera images, and helpful
utility functions in training and testing the CNN model

### notebook
Analysis, artifacts, and real life images of 3D printed object
